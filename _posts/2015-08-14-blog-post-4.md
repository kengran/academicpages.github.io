Here you can find the atomic coordination files in .car format from my paper on modeling of the early stage formation mechanisms of cementitious materials. They include:

- Ca<sub>2+</sub>, Ca(OH)<sup>+</sup>, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>
- SiO<sub>x</sub>(OH)<sub>4-x</sub><sup>x</sup>
- Al(OH)<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>

They could serve as a good starting point if you want to do atomic simulation on the same/similar species. Please contact me if you have any questions when using these files!
